      <h3>How To Use</h3>
      <ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            Establish a security operations center (SOC) to monitor the
            organization's security posture and respond to security incidents (IBM 2022).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement security information and event management (SIEM) systems
            to collect and analyze security event data (Arnold, 2011).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Use log aggregation tools to centralize security event logs for
            analysis (Brain, 2017).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement security incident response plans to quickly and
            effectively respond to security incidents (Paul et al, 2012).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Use incident response playbooks to guide incident response
            activities (Andreas, 2022).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement security incident detection and response tools to
            automatically detect and respond to security incidents (Threat intelligence, 2023).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Regularly conduct security awareness training for all employees to
            educate them on security risks and how to protect the organization
            from security threats (Jenn, 2022).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Use threat intelligence to identify potential threats and
            vulnerabilities relevant to the organization (ISBuzz Staff, 2015).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Use network and application security scanners to identify potential
            security vulnerabilities in the organization's network and
            applications (National Cyber Security Centre, 2021).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Use penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in
            the organization's systems and applications (Konstantinos, 2012).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement security-focused design reviews to identify potential
            security risks in new systems and applications (Paul, 2022).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Use security metrics to measure the effectiveness of the
            organization's security posture and identify potential areas for
            improvement (ProServeIT, 2017).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Use continuous monitoring to identify potential security incidents
            in real-time (RiskOptics, 2023).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement incident response plans to quickly and effectively
            respond to security incidents (SecurityMetrics Inc, 2023).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Regularly review and update the organization's security operations
            processes to ensure that they remain effective and up-to-date (Daniel 2019).
        </p>
    </li>
