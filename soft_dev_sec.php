      <h3>How To Use</h3>
      <ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement secure coding practices, such as input validation and
            error handling, to prevent common software vulnerabilities like
            injection attacks (OWASP Top Ten, 2021).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Conduct regular code reviews to identify and remediate potential
            security vulnerabilities in the software code (Thien, 2002).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Use static code analysis tools to automatically identify potential
            security vulnerabilities in the software code (OWASP 2023).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) practices,
            such as threat modeling and security testing, to identify and
            mitigate potential security risks throughout the software
            development process (Microsoft Build 2022).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Regularly update and patch software to address known security
            vulnerabilities (Brad 2007).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement access controls to limit access to sensitive software
            development resources, such as source code repositories and build
            servers.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Use secure software configuration management practices to protect
            software development artifacts and prevent unauthorized changes (Anold J et al, 2011).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)
            practices to automate and streamline software development and
            deployment processes (AWS 2023).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Use containerization and virtualization technologies to isolate and
            secure software development environments (Gursimran 2022).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement network security controls, such as firewalls and
            intrusion detection systems, to protect software development
            environments from external threats (Cisco 2023).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Regularly conduct security awareness training for software
            developers to educate them on secure coding practices and potential
            security risks (Cindy 2009).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Use secure software libraries and frameworks to reduce the risk of
            introducing vulnerabilities through third-party software
            components (Andrew 2018).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Use encryption and secure key management practices to protect
            sensitive data used in software development (Elaine 2020).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Regularly conduct vulnerability scanning and penetration testing of
            software development environments to identify potential security
            risks (RedLegg 2022).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement incident response plans to quickly and effectively
            respond to security incidents involving software development
            environments (FIPS 2004).
        </p>
    </li>
