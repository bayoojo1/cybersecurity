      <h3>How To Use</h3>
      <ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            Conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential asset
            security vulnerabilities (Feng et al, 2014).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Develop and implement an asset management program to ensure that
            all assets are properly tracked and managed (McLachlan, 2008).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel
            have access to critical assets (Ward and Smith, 2002).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Use encryption to protect data on assets that are vulnerable to
            theft or unauthorized access (Sattarova and Kim, 2007).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement strong authentication mechanisms to ensure that only
            authorized users have access to critical assets (Campbell et al, 2003).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement physical security controls to protect assets from theft,
            damage, or unauthorized access (Stallings, 2014).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Use intrusion detection systems to monitor and alert security
            personnel to any potential security breaches (Debar, 2000).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement firewalls and other network security measures to protect
            assets from external threats (Stewart, 2013).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Conduct regular security audits to identify potential
            vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the security system (Pereira and Santos, 2010).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement security policies and procedures to ensure that all
            employees are aware of their responsibilities and obligations
            regarding asset security (Da Veiga and Ellof, 2010).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Train employees on the importance of asset security and how to
            protect critical assets from security threats (Alshaikh, 2020).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement backup and disaster recovery procedures to ensure that
            critical assets can be quickly restored in the event of a security
            breach or natural disaster (Hawkins et al, 2000).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Conduct regular vulnerability scans to identify and mitigate
            potential security vulnerabilities in the IT infrastructure (RedLegg, 2022).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement a formal incident response plan to ensure that all
            security incidents are quickly and effectively addressed (Scanfone et al, 2008).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Regularly review and update the security controls in place to
            ensure that they are up-to-date and effective in protecting
            critical assets from security threats (Ma, 2009).
        </p>
