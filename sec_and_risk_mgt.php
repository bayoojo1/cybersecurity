        <li>
            <p>
                Develop and implement a formal security and risk management program
                to ensure that all security risks are identified and managed
                effectively (Stoneburner, 2002).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential security
                risks and vulnerabilities (Sánchez, 2011).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Develop and implement security policies and procedures to ensure
                that all employees are aware of their responsibilities and
                obligations regarding security and risk management (Ward and Smith, 2002).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Regularly review and update security policies and procedures to
                ensure that they are up-to-date and effective in protecting the
                organization from security threats (Ma, 2009).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Implement security awareness training for all employees to educate
                them on security risks and how to protect the organization from
                security threats (Dash and Ansari, 2022).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Use encryption to protect sensitive data in transit and at rest (Ghouse et al, 2019).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Implement access controls to restrict access to critical resources
                to only those users who require it (Ferraiolo et al, 1999).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Use firewalls and other network security measures to protect the
                network from external threats (Stewart, 2013).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems to monitor the
                network for potential security breaches (Beigh and Peer, 2011).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Use security incident and event management (SIEM) systems to detect
                and respond to security incidents in real-time (González-Granadillo et al, 2021).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Develop and implement a formal incident response plan to ensure
                that all security incidents are quickly and effectively addressed (Scanfone et al, 2008).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Regularly test and audit the security controls in place to identify
                potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses (Shah and Mehtre, 2015).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Use third-party risk assessments to identify and manage risks
                associated with third-party vendors and partners (Saint-Germain, 2005).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Regularly review and update the organization's business continuity
                and disaster recovery plans to ensure that critical resources can
                be quickly restored in the event of a security breach or natural
                disaster (Wallace and Webber, 2017).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>
            Regularly report on the status of the security and risk management
            program to senior management and stakeholders to ensure that they
            are aware of the organization's security posture and any potential
            risks (Webb et al, 2014).
