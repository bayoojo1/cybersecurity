      <h3>How To Use</h3>
      <ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement secure communication protocols, such as SSL/TLS, for all
            network traffic to prevent eavesdropping and data interception (Adeyinka, 2008).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Use strong authentication mechanisms, such as two-factor
            authentication, to ensure that only authorized users have access to
            the network (Ibrokhimov et al, 2019).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement access controls to limit access to network resources to
            only those users who require it (Sandhu et al, 1996).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement firewalls and other perimeter security measures to
            protect the network from external threats (Fortinet 2023).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Regularly update and patch all network devices to ensure that they
            are protected against known vulnerabilities (Brad, 2007).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Use intrusion detection and prevention systems to monitor the
            network for potential security breaches (Paloalto, 2023).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Use network segmentation to isolate critical assets and restrict
            access to them (Klein, 2019).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement network monitoring tools to detect and respond to
            security incidents in real-time (González-Granadillo et al, 2021).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Use strong encryption to protect data in transit and at rest (Ghouse et al, 2019).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement a formal incident response plan to ensure that all
            security incidents are quickly and effectively addressed (Scanfone et al, 2008).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Regularly conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration testing
            to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the network (Konstantinos, 2012).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Train employees on the importance of network security and how to
            protect the network from security threats (Alshaikh, 2020).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement backup and disaster recovery procedures to ensure that
            critical data can be quickly restored in the event of a security
            breach or natural disaster (Hawkins et al, 2000).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement network access control to ensure that only authorized
            devices can connect to the network (Annuar et al, 2013).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Regularly review and update the network security controls in place
            to ensure that they are up-to-date and effective in protecting the
            network from security threats (Ma, 2009).
