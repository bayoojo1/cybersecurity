            <p>
                Implement a secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) to ensure
                that software is developed with security in mind from the start (Snyk Limited 2023).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Use secure coding practices to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities
                in software code (Snyk Limited 2023).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Use static and dynamic code analysis tools to identify potential
                security vulnerabilities in software code (Tom 2021).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Implement secure coding standards and guidelines to ensure that all
                developers follow best practices for secure coding (Software Testing Help 2023).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Use threat modeling to identify potential security risks in
                software design and architecture (Synopsis 2023).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Implement secure network architecture to protect critical resources
                from external threats (Vaadata 2022).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Use encryption to protect sensitive data in transit and at rest (NCSC 2022).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Use secure authentication and access control mechanisms to restrict
                access to critical resources (NCSC 2021).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Use firewalls and other network security measures to protect the
                network from external threats (Fortinet 2023).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems to monitor the
                network for potential security breaches (Paloalto 2023).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Use security incident and event management (SIEM) systems to detect
                and respond to security incidents in real-time (Microsoft 2023).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Regularly test and audit the security controls in place to identify
                potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses (NCSC 2019).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Use secure hardware and firmware components to reduce the risk of
                hardware-based vulnerabilities (Bret 2021).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>
            Implement secure data storage practices to protect sensitive data
            at rest (Coos, 2021).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Use secure protocols and standards for all communications to reduce
            the risk of interception or eavesdropping (Adeyinka, 2008).
